            <h2>1. Time Complexity Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Time complexity helps determine the efficiency of an algorithm by measuring how its runtime grows relative to the input size. It is expressed using notations like O(n), O(log n), etc.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Challenges in Learning/Understanding:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understanding how nested loops or recursion contribute to time complexity can be hard initially.</li>
                        <li>Differentiating between best-case, worst-case, and average-case complexities.</li>
                        <li>Identifying time complexities in unfamiliar algorithms like divide-and-conquer.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Challenges in Real-World Applications:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Translating theoretical complexity into real-world performance metrics.</li>
                        <li>Handling scenarios where algorithms with better theoretical complexity (e.g., O(log n)) perform poorly due to high constant factors or memory limitations.</li>
                        <li>In real-time systems, even a theoretically fast algorithm may not meet strict time constraints.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Determining the Most Efficient Approach:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analyze problem constraints: For small inputs, simpler algorithms (e.g., O(nÂ²)) might suffice; for large inputs, prioritize O(n log n) solutions.</li>
                        <li>Use profiling tools to measure real-world performance and adjust the algorithm if needed.</li>
                        <li>Example: In searching, binary search (O(log n)) is preferred over linear search (O(n)) when the data is sorted.</li>
